CSix Connect
=============

This project, **CSix Connect**, is the capstone project for [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) [**"Android Developer Nanodegree"** program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801).

### **_Introduction:_**

**_C_**ommunicate your need

**_S_**tate your goal

e**_X_**change job leads

This is an Android application for CSIX CONNECT (www.csix.org).

Located in the San Francisco Bay area, CSIX CONNECT helps individuals in career transition to significantly improve their job search success through education, in-person networking, and mutual support. CSIX is built on the belief that networking is most effective when done face-to-face.

This app intents to provide existing and potential CSIX members information about the organization, upcoming events, special interest groups, and direction to meetings...

### **_User Stories:_**

* Update upcoming events
  * User shall be able to check upcoming CSIX events (Speaker and Topic)

  * User shall be able to share event to other people or media

### **_Note:_**

CSIX Connect is a nonprofit organization I am involved in recent years. I have done an simple app (https://github.com/fengsterooni/CSIX) for the organization several months ago, but it is really premature to be published.

In this capstone project, following features are implemented:

* Data Persistence: Content provider to store data locally
* Cursor Loader
* Google Cloud Endpoint to store/update data sets for client app
* Material design: AppBar, parallax scrolling, and shared element transition...
* Both phone and tablet support
* Paid and free flavors
* Google Play Services: Map, Location, Ads
* Gradle build
* Testing
* Notifications
* ShareActionProvider
* Widgets

Of course, there is always room to greatly improve this app.
